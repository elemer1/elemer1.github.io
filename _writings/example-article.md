This is an example article with a simple filename.

## How to Add Articles

You can now add Markdown files to the `_writings/` folder with **any filename** you want:

- `my-thoughts.md`
- `interesting-idea.md`
- `economics-notes.md`

No need for date prefixes!

### Front Matter

Each file just needs a front matter section at the top:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Article Title"
date: 2025-01-15  # Optional: include if you want to show date
---
```

If you don't include a `date`, no date will be displayed on the homepage.

### Publishing

Simply:
1. Create or edit a `.md` file in `_writings/` folder
2. Commit and push to GitHub
3. Your article will appear automatically!
